<p align="justify"> I lead the LLM Team at SambaNova Systems. The LLM team at SambaNova focuses on understanding how to train and evaluate HHH aligned large language models, adapting LLMs to enterprise use-cases and HW-SW co-design of LLMs to enable efficient training and inference. Before SambaNova, I was in various engineering and research roles at Arm, AMD and Texas Instruments. I have also helped drive the TinyML Performance Working Group in MLPerf, contributing to the development of key benchmarks for IoT ML. I have 35+ publications and patents focusing on efficient deep learning and LLMs. His papers have been published at top ML and HW conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, EMNLP and ISCA and have been an invited speaker at various top universities and industry academia summits. I completed my masters at the University of Wisconsin Madison and bachelors from Birla Institute of Technology and Science. </p>
