<p align="justify"> I lead the Foundation ML Team at SambaNova Systems. The team focuses on understanding how to train and evaluate Foundation Models for various modalities, adapting them to enterprise use-cases and HW-SW co-design of Foundation Models to enable efficient training and inference. Before SambaNova, I was in various engineering and research roles at Arm, AMD and Texas Instruments. I have also helped drive the TinyML Performance Working Group in MLPerf, contributing to the development of key benchmarks for IoT ML. I have 45+ publications and patents focusing on efficient deep learning and Generative Models across top ML and HW conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, EMNLP and ISCA. I have been an invited speaker at various top universities and industry academia summits. I completed my masters at the University of Wisconsin Madison and bachelors from Birla Institute of Technology and Science. </p>
