<p align="justify"> I am an ML Research & Engineering leader focused on translating cutting-edge AI research into high-impact, scalable products. Throughout my career, I’ve led large, multi-disciplinary organizations—spanning product, applied research, efficiency research, infrastructure, and agentic AI—to build and deploy large scale systems. These systems have served XXXM+ weekly requests and generated hundreds of millions in annual revenue. </p>
<br>
<p align="justify"> With 60+ publications, 7000+ citations, and multiple patents across foundation models, efficient training, and high-performance inference, my work consistently bridges deep technical innovation with real-world deployment at scale. I’ve driven company-wide efficiency initiatives, developed models downloaded over 100 million times, and launched industry–academia collaborations with leading universities to advance the state of the art in generative AI.</p><br>

<p align="justify"> I thrive on solving hard, high-leverage problems—from large-scale model training and architectural optimization to throughput-critical inference pipelines and cross-functional team leadership. I’ve been invited to speak at top AI conferences and universities, sharing insights on the future of generative models and production-grade AI systems. </p> <br>

<p align="justify"> My leadership philosophy is simple: build exceptional teams, foster a culture of innovation and rigor, and deliver measurable, durable impact. Whether pioneering new research directions, strengthening engineering excellence, or scaling AI products from concept to millions of users, I’m driven by creating technology—and organizations—that last. </p>
