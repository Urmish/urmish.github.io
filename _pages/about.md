<p align="justify"> I’m an ML Research & Engineering executive/ lead passionate about turning cutting-edge AI research into high-impact products. Over my career, I’ve led large, multi-disciplinary teams—spanning product, applied research, efficiency research, infrastructure, and agentic AI—to build and deploy large scale systems. I have built systems that handle XXXM+ weekly requests and generate YYY of millions in annual revenue.
With 50+ publications, 6,700+ citations, and multiple patents in foundation models, efficient training, and inference, my work bridges deep technical innovation with practical deployment at scale. I’ve driven company-wide efficiency initiatives, developed models downloaded over 100M times, and launched industry–academia collaborations with leading universities to push the state of the art in generative AI.
I thrive on solving hard problems—whether it’s training large scale models, optimizing model architectures, scaling training, improving inference efficiency, or leading cross-functional teams to deliver breakthrough capabilities. I’ve also been invited to speak at top AI conferences and universities, sharing insights on the future of generative AI and large-scale deployment.
My leadership philosophy is simple: build exceptional teams, foster a culture of innovation and rigor, and deliver measurable impact. Whether it’s pioneering new research directions, streamlining engineering processes, or bringing AI products from concept to millions of users, I focus on making meaningful contributions that last.
